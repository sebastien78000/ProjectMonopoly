# ProjectMonopoly

This project was made in order to practice design patterns, good software development practice and to improve on WPF for design.

This is a simple implementation of the Monopoly game, where players can only roll the dices and go to jail, the goal is to be the first player to finish 5 laps.
Further development could be to implement the transaction aspect of the game, but it is not the purpose for now.
